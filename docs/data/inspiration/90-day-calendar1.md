## Key Training Principles

**Progressive Overload:** Increase weight, reps, or intensity by 5-10% each phase while maintaining perfect form.

**Deload Weeks (Every 4 weeks):** Weeks 4, 8, and 12 include reduced intensity to allow recovery and adaptation.

**Plyometric Rotation:** All three plyometric versions rotate throughout the 90 days to develop different aspects of lower body power and conditioning.

**Active Recovery:** Saturday sessions maintain movement without significant fatigue accumulation.

**Rest Days:** Sunday provides full recovery or light mobility work with X-Stretch.

**Strength + Core Split:** Each strength day is followed by a core session (either same day or separate based on preference/schedule).

---

## Weekly Training Volume Summary

**Per Week:**
- **Strength Training:** 3 days (Mon, Wed, Fri) × 9 exercises = 27 strength exercises
- **Core Training:** 3 days (Mon, Wed, Fri) × 10 exercises = 30 core exercises
- **Plyometric Conditioning:** 1 day (Tue) × 24-72 exercises = 24 plyometric exercises
- **Yoga/Mobility:** 1 day (Thu) = 60-90 minutes recovery
- **Active Recovery:** 1 day (Sat) = 30-45 minutes light movement
- **Rest:** 1 day (Sun) = Complete recovery or optional light stretching

**Total Weekly Commitment:** 4-5 hours of structured training

## Nutrition & Recovery Notes

- Sleep 7-9 hours nightly
- Consume protein with each meal (aim for 1.6-2.2g per kg of bodyweight)
- Hydrate adequately throughout workouts
- Track strength progression in your main lifts (Barbell Bench, Seated Cable Row, Squat variations)
- Use post-workout nutrition within 30-60 minutes of completing strength workouts

---

## Expected Results by Day 90

- Increased upper body pushing and pulling strength (10-20% gains)
- Improved lower body power and explosiveness
- Enhanced cardiovascular conditioning from plyometric work
- Greater core stability and strength from consistent Core training
- Improved movement quality and body awareness
- Better resilience to hockey-specific demands (lateral agility, rapid direction changes, powerful strides)
- Visible muscle definition in chest, shoulders, arms, and legs
- Improved single-leg stability and control

---

## Core Workout Flexibility

The **Core** sessions (10 exercises, 15 minutes) can be performed in multiple ways:

**Option 1: Same-Day Session**
- Complete all 9 strength exercises first
- Immediately follow with 10 core exercises
- Total time: 60 minutes

**Option 2: Separate Session**
- Complete strength workout in morning or primary session
- Complete core workout in evening or later in day
- Allows better recovery between sessions

**Option 3: Abbreviated**
- If time-limited, prioritize strength work
- Complete core work when schedule allows
- Don't skip entirely - core is essential for stability and injury prevention
