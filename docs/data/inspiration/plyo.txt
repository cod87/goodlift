ROTATION SUGGESTION FOR WEEKLY PROGRAMMING:
- Week 1: Version 1 (Monday), Version 2 (Thursday)
- Week 2: Version 3 (Monday), Version 1 (Thursday)

GENERAL NOTES FOR ALL VERSIONS:
- Maintain controlled landings to minimize joint impact
- Use your step to reduce ground force where applicable
- Modify jump heights based on energy and form quality
- Stay hydrated during extended rest periods
- Track which version produces best results and soreness patterns
- Rest adequately between sessions (48 hours minimum between intensive plyometric workouts)
