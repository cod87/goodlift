- Maintain perfect form

## NOTES FOR SUCCESS

**Form First:** Never sacrifice form for weight. Quality reps build better physique and prevent injury.

**Consistency:** Missing a single workout won't derail you. Missing a week will. Prioritize consistency.

**Recovery:** The gains happen during rest. Sleep 7-9 hours and manage stress.

**Hydration & Nutrition:** Drink water throughout workouts. Eat protein and carbs post-workout.

**Tracking:** Keep a simple log of weights used and how you felt. This drives motivation and ensures progression.

**Listen to Your Body:** If something hurts (not muscle burn), modify or skip it. Train hard but smart.

## CORE WORKOUT FLEXIBILITY

The **Core** sessions can be performed in multiple ways:

**Option 1: Same-Day Session**

**Option 2: Separate Session**
- Complete strength workout in morning
- Complete core workout in evening or later in day
- Allows better recovery between sessions

**Option 3: Abbreviated**
- If time-limited, prioritize strength work
- Complete core work when schedule allows
- Don't skip entirely - core is essential for stability
