/**
 * Muscle Highlight SVG Utility
 * 
 * This module has been simplified. Dynamic SVG generation has been removed.
 * All exercise images are now rendered directly from the explicit image field in exercises.json.
 * 
 * SVG muscle diagrams should be pre-generated and stored in public/svg-muscles/
 * and referenced directly in the exercise.image field.
 * 
 * This file is kept as a placeholder to avoid breaking imports, but contains no functionality.
